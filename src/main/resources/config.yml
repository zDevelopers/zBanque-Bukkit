# This system supports multiple banks.
# To create a new bank, simply copy-paste the `main` entry under it at the
# same level (with four spaces before), and updates the key (`main`, as this
# key must be unique) and the content.
#
# Example:
#
# banks:
#     main:
#         # The bank display name
#         name: "Main bank"
#
#         # The bank's location.
#         world: "world"
#         firstCorner: "-10;0;-10"
#         otherCorner: "10;60;10"
#
#     other-bank:
#         # The bank display name
#         name: "Other bank"
#
#         # The bank's location.
#         world: "world"
#         firstCorner: "-100;0;-100"
#         otherCorner: "-60;120;-30"
